- Disrupting services (DoS attacks)
- Encrypting data for ransom
- Gaining unauthorized access (backdoors)

## 🦠 1. Viruses

Viruses are programs that **attach themselves to legitimate files** and replicate when the infected file is executed.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- Needs user action to spread
- Can corrupt or delete files
- Common in .exe or macro files

### 🛠 Examples:
- CIH (Chernobyl)
- Melissa Macro Virus
- ILOVEYOU Virus

### 🔍 Prevention:
- Use antivirus software
- Avoid opening unknown email attachments

## 🪱 2. Worms

Worms are standalone programs that **replicate themselves** and spread across networks **without human interaction**.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- Can exhaust system/network resources
- Often used to deliver payloads like ransomware

### 🛠 Examples:
- Code Red
- SQL Slammer
- WannaCry (also considered ransomware)

### 🔍 Prevention:
- Patch OS vulnerabilities
- Enable firewalls and intrusion detection systems

## 🐴 3. Trojans (Trojan Horses)

Trojans disguise themselves as **legitimate software** but deliver a malicious payload once installed.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- Does not replicate itself
- Often used to create backdoors

### 🛠 Examples:
- Zeus (banking Trojan)
- Emotet
- Remote Access Trojans (RATs)

### 🔍 Prevention:
- Verify sources of downloads
- Use application whitelisting

## 💰 4. Ransomware

Ransomware **encrypts user files or locks systems** and demands ransom (usually in cryptocurrency) for restoring access.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- High-impact: affects individuals and organizations
- Targets critical data (databases, user documents)

### 🛠 Examples:
- WannaCry
- Petya / NotPetya
- Ryuk

### 🔍 Prevention:
- Regular data backups
- Use endpoint protection tools
- Educate users on phishing tactics
