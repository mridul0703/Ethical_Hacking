# 102. Phases of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking is a structured process divided into key phases, designed to simulate the real steps a malicious attacker might take — but under legal and controlled conditions.

> 🛠️ *Understanding each phase helps ensure thorough security assessments and effective risk mitigation.*

---

## 🧭 Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

Reconnaissance is the **pre-attack phase**, where the hacker collects as much information as possible about the target.

### 🔍 Types of Reconnaissance:
- **Passive**: No direct contact with the target (e.g., WHOIS, public records, social media).
- **Active**: Direct interaction with the system (e.g., ping sweeps, port scans).

### 📌 Tools:
- Google Hacking (Dorking)
- Maltego
- Recon-ng

---

## 📡 Phase 2: Scanning

This phase involves using tools to identify open ports, active devices, and vulnerabilities.

### ⚙️ Types of Scanning:
- **Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports (e.g., using Nmap).
- **Network Scanning**: Maps out network structure.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifies known flaws (e.g., using Nessus).

### 🧪 Tools:
- Nmap
- Nessus
- Angry IP Scanner

---

## 🔓 Phase 3: Gaining Access

The attacker uses the information gathered to **exploit vulnerabilities** and gain unauthorized access.

### 🚪 Techniques:
- Exploiting software bugs
- SQL Injection
- Buffer Overflows
- Password Cracking

### 🧰 Tools:
- Metasploit
- Hydra
- SQLmap

---

## 📥 Phase 4: Maintaining Access

After access is gained, the hacker tries to **create a backdoor** to return later without detection.

### 👣 Common Methods:
- Rootkits
- Trojans
- Creating Admin Accounts

### 🛡️ Purpose:
- Stay inside the system
- Escalate privileges
- Launch further attacks

---

## 🧹 Phase 5: Covering Tracks

In this final phase, the attacker attempts to **erase evidence** of their presence and actions.

### 🧼 Techniques:
- Clearing logs
- Disabling auditing
- Using encrypted channels

> ⚠️ *This is illegal without authorization. Ethical hackers simulate this phase to test incident detection systems.*

## 🔁 Why This Phased Approach?

- Encourages **methodical assessment**
- Ensures **comprehensive security coverage**
- Mimics **real attacker behavior**
- Helps teams **respond effectively** to each attack vector
