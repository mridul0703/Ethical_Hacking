# 302. Enumeration

Enumeration is the process of **actively extracting information** from a target system after it has been identified as a potential entry point. This is a deeper stage than footprinting, involving active interaction with the system to gather more detailed information such as users, groups, services, and shares.

## 📌 What is Enumeration?

Enumeration is the process of gathering detailed information about a **network or system** to discover available services, users, groups, and other details that could be leveraged in an attack.

### 🔍 Key Information Gathered During Enumeration:
- Usernames and group names
- Machine names and domain names
- Shared resources (e.g., file shares, printers)
- Network services (e.g., mail servers, database servers)
- Active Directory and other directory services information

## 🌐 Types of Enumeration

### ✅ 1. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Enumeration

SNMP is used by devices (routers, switches, etc.) to exchange management information. An attacker can enumerate device configurations and settings.

#### 🧰 Techniques:
- Querying SNMP community strings to extract sensitive information (e.g., `public`, `private`)

#### 🛠 Tools:
- **Nmap**: `nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-info <target>`
- **Snmpwalk**: Retrieves full SNMP information

> ⚠️ **Vulnerabilities**: Misconfigured SNMP settings can leak device configurations, user details, and network information.

### ✅ 2. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) Enumeration

LDAP is used for directory services, such as querying information about users, groups, and devices within a domain.

#### 🧰 Techniques:
- Querying for usernames, groups, and other resources in an Active Directory (AD) or LDAP server

#### 🛠 Tools:
- **Nmap**: `nmap -p 389 --script ldap-search <target>`
- **ldapsearch**: A command-line tool for querying LDAP directories
- **Ldapenum**: A tool specifically for enumerating LDAP directories

> 🔍 **LDAP Enumeration Example**: Retrieving usernames from an AD server for a targeted organization.

### ✅ 3. NetBIOS Enumeration

NetBIOS is a legacy network protocol used for file and printer sharing in Windows environments. Enumerating NetBIOS can provide access to shared resources and information about the target system.

#### 🧰 Techniques:
- Querying NetBIOS for open shares, user lists, and more

#### 🛠 Tools:
- **Nmap**: `nmap -p 137 --script nbstat <target>`
- **Net View**: Command to show shared resources
- **NBScan**: A tool for NetBIOS enumeration

> 🔓 **NetBIOS Vulnerabilities**: Reveals sensitive network details such as computer names, workgroups, and available shares.

## 🛠 Tools for Enumeration

### 1. **Nmap**
Nmap is a versatile tool that can be used for multiple enumeration purposes, such as SNMP, LDAP, and NetBIOS. It also has several scripts for specific enumeration tasks.

#### 🧰 Example Nmap Command:
- For SNMP enumeration: `nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-info <target>`
- For LDAP enumeration: `nmap -p 389 --script ldap-search <target>`
- For NetBIOS enumeration: `nmap -p 137 --script nbstat <target>`

### 2. **Nessus**
Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that can also be used for detailed enumeration, including discovering services and configurations.

### 3. **OpenVAS**
OpenVAS is another vulnerability scanner that supports enumeration of services, identifying potential attack vectors.

## 📘 Summary

- **Enumeration** is the process of actively probing and extracting detailed system information.
- **SNMP**, **LDAP**, and **NetBIOS** are common protocols targeted during enumeration for information extraction.
- **Nmap**, **Nessus**, and **OpenVAS** are tools that assist in these enumeration tasks, helping ethical hackers gain insights into potential attack vectors.

> ⚠️ *It is essential to ensure that all enumeration activities are performed with the necessary authorization to avoid legal repercussions.*
