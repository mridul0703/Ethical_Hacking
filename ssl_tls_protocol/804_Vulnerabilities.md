# 804. Vulnerabilities

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities often arise from misconfigurations, weak protocols, and exploitation of flaws in software systems. Understanding these vulnerabilities is essential for identifying weaknesses and preventing malicious exploitation.

> ⚠️ *"Every vulnerability is a potential doorway for attackers."*

## 🛡️ SSL Stripping

SSL Stripping is an **attack** that downgrades a secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection. This is typically done by an attacker who intercepts and modifies communication between the client and server.

### ⚙️ How SSL Stripping Works:
1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attack intercepts the communication.
2. The attacker forces the connection to downgrade from HTTPS (secure) to HTTP (insecure).
3. The client sends data over the unencrypted HTTP protocol, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping or modification.

### 🛠️ Steps Involved:
1. The attacker intercepts a **client request** to an HTTPS-enabled server.
2. The attacker responds with an HTTP connection instead of HTTPS.
3. The client does not notice the change and proceeds with sending sensitive data (such as login credentials) over HTTP.

### 🧰 Protection Against SSL Stripping:
- Use **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** to enforce HTTPS connections.
- Ensure **SSL/TLS certificates** are configured properly.
- Avoid using **HTTP redirect chains** that may lead to HTTP instead of HTTPS.

## 🐍 BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS)

BEAST is a **vulnerability** in the SSL/TLS protocol, specifically targeting **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode** used in older versions of SSL/TLS. This vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt **secure traffic** between the client and server.

### ⚠️ How BEAST Works:
- BEAST exploits a weakness in the **TLS 1.0** and **SSL 3.0** protocols.
- It allows an attacker to perform a **chosen-plaintext attack**.
- The attacker can decrypt and retrieve information about the encrypted data stream.

### 🛠️ Steps Involved:
1. The attacker positions themselves between the client and server to **eavesdrop** on the communication.
2. The attacker sends **crafted data packets** to force the client and server to use a vulnerable SSL/TLS cipher suite.
3. The attacker successfully **decrypts parts** of the data, potentially retrieving sensitive information like cookies or session tokens.

### 🧰 Mitigation Techniques:
- Use **TLS 1.2** or newer versions instead of **TLS 1.0** or **SSL 3.0**.
- Ensure servers disable support for **weak cipher suites**.
- Implement **Secure Cookie Flags** and **HTTP-only** cookies to prevent session hijacking.

## 🧸 POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)

POODLE is an **exploit** that targets vulnerabilities in the **SSL 3.0** protocol and allows an attacker to decrypt encrypted data by exploiting a flaw in how SSL 3.0 handles padding.

### ⚠️ How POODLE Works:
- The POODLE attack takes advantage of how **SSL 3.0** handles padding when encrypting data in **block cipher** modes.
- The attacker can manipulate the encrypted data, decrypt parts of the traffic, and retrieve sensitive information such as authentication tokens or session cookies.

### 🛠️ Steps Involved:
1. The attacker forces a downgrade from **TLS** to **SSL 3.0** (through MitM or other techniques).
2. The attacker injects **maliciously crafted packets** into the communication stream.
3. The attacker exploits the padding vulnerability to decrypt parts of the data being transmitted.

### 🧰 Protection Against POODLE:
- Disable **SSL 3.0** on both the client and server side.
- Enable **TLS 1.2** or higher, which does not have the padding oracle vulnerability.
- Implement **HSTS** to prevent SSL/TLS downgrade attacks.
- Regularly **update** SSL/TLS libraries to ensure the latest patches are applied.

## 📘 Summary of SSL Stripping, BEAST, and POODLE Attacks

| Attack Type      | Affected Protocol | Description                                                                                     | Mitigation                                         |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **SSL Stripping** | HTTPS             | Downgrades secure HTTPS connections to unencrypted HTTP for interception and eavesdropping.      | Use HSTS, proper SSL/TLS configurations.           |
| **BEAST**        | SSL/TLS 1.0       | Exploits CBC mode weaknesses in SSL/TLS to decrypt secure traffic.                               | Use TLS 1.2 or higher, disable weak cipher suites. |
| **POODLE**       | SSL 3.0           | Exploits padding vulnerabilities in SSL 3.0 to decrypt traffic.                                  | Disable SSL 3.0, enable TLS 1.2+ and apply updates.|
