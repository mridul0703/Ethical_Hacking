# 402. Methodology of Penetration Testing

Penetration Testing, also called ethical hacking, follows a structured **methodology** that ensures systematic identification, exploitation, and reporting of vulnerabilities.

> 🧠 *"A methodical pen test not only finds flaws — it proves how they can be abused, and how they should be fixed."*

## 📝 1. Planning and Reconnaissance

This is the **foundation phase** of penetration testing, where objectives, scope, and rules of engagement are clearly defined. It includes **passive and active reconnaissance** to gather intelligence.

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Define client expectations
- Identify target systems and technologies
- Understand the organization’s threat landscape

### 🔧 Substeps:

#### 1.1 Define Scope and Goals
- Determine what systems and applications are in-scope
- Understand legal limitations and compliance requirements

#### 1.2 Threat Modeling
- Identify valuable assets and likely threats
- Create attacker personas or threat actor simulations

#### 1.3 Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)
- Passive: WHOIS, DNS, Google Dorking, social media
- Active: Port scanning, banner grabbing, ping sweeps

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Maltego
- Shodan
- Recon-ng
- Google search operators

> 🧭 Output: A blueprint of the target’s environment including IPs, domains, technologies used, and potential weak points.

## 💣 2. Exploitation

This phase involves **actively launching attacks** to validate the vulnerabilities discovered during reconnaissance. It aims to access unauthorized systems, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data.

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Confirm the presence of vulnerabilities
- Demonstrate real-world impact without causing harm

### 🔧 Substeps:

#### 2.1 Vulnerability Scanning
- Automated or manual tools to detect common flaws (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations)

#### 2.2 Exploit Execution
- Use known exploits or custom payloads to gain access
- Avoid causing service disruption or data loss

#### 2.3 Privilege Escalation
- Attempt to elevate user access to root/admin level

#### 2.4 Post-Exploitation
- Extract passwords, tokens, or sensitive data
- Analyze pivoting opportunities for lateral movement

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Metasploit Framework
- Burp Suite
- SQLmap
- Exploit-DB
- Hydra / John the Ripper

> ⚠️ Ethical hackers must take care to **avoid damage**, operate within **scope**, and log all activities.

## 🧾 3. Reporting

This phase documents everything discovered and done during the penetration test. The final report should be **clear, professional, and actionable**.

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Summarize findings in non-technical and technical formats
- Prioritize issues based on risk
- Provide remediation steps

### 🔧 Subsections of a Good Report:

#### 3.1 Executive Summary
- Overview of goals, scope, major findings
- Written in simple language for non-technical stakeholders

#### 3.2 Technical Findings
- Each vulnerability with:
  - Description
  - Affected systems
  - Reproduction steps
  - Evidence/screenshots
  - CVSS or severity score

#### 3.3 Risk Analysis
- Business impact of each issue
- Risk ratings: High, Medium, Low, Informational

#### 3.4 Recommendations
- Fixes, patches, configuration changes
- Preventive and monitoring suggestions

#### 3.5 Appendices
- Tools used
- Methodology references
- Logs, scripts, payloads used

> 🧠 The value of a pen test lies not only in the findings, but in how clearly and constructively they are communicated.
