# 901. Firewalls and Types of Firewalls

Firewalls are a critical part of network security. They act as a **barrier between a trusted internal network** and untrusted external networks like the internet, helping to **filter traffic** and protect systems from cyber threats.

> 🔐 *“Firewalls are your first line of defense against cyber-attacks.”*

## 🌐 What is a Firewall?

A firewall is a **security system** designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It can either allow or block traffic based on its inspection of data packets.

## 🔒 1. Types of Firewalls

Firewalls come in various types, each with its own unique features and security strengths. Below are the most common types of firewalls:

### ✅ 1.1 Packet Filtering Firewall

**Packet Filtering** is the most basic type of firewall that inspects each packet of data sent to or from the system.

#### 🛠 Features:
- Inspects packets individually, checking headers for allowed or disallowed information.
- Relies on predefined security rules (IP addresses, protocols, ports).
- **Stateless** — Doesn't track the state of the connection.

#### 🧩 Advantages:
- Simple and efficient for basic security.
- Low resource usage.

#### ❌ Disadvantages:
- Can't detect attacks based on session states.
- Susceptible to IP spoofing and other packet manipulation techniques.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:
- Used in routers and other network devices for simple traffic filtering.

---

### ✅ 1.2 Stateful Inspection Firewall

**Stateful Inspection** firewalls track the state of active connections, allowing them to be more secure than simple packet filters.

#### 🛠 Features:
- Tracks **the state** of active connections and determines whether a packet is part of an established connection.
- Keeps track of session information, such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocol state.

#### 🧩 Advantages:
- More secure than packet filtering as it understands context.
- Can prevent certain types of attacks, such as spoofing.

#### ❌ Disadvantages:
- More resource-intensive than packet filtering.
- Can be overwhelmed by large volumes of traffic.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:
- Commonly used in **enterprise environments** or for secure network borders.

---

### ✅ 1.3 Proxy Firewalls

**Proxy Firewalls** act as intermediaries between the internal network and external services. They **filter traffic** by **retrieving** information on behalf of the client.

#### 🛠 Features:
- **Application-level** firewall — Operates at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model).
- Intercepts and **relays requests** between clients and servers.
- Can inspect data beyond just header information (e.g., content inspection).

#### 🧩 Advantages:
- Can block malicious content from web pages, emails, and files.
- Provides additional anonymity for internal systems.

#### ❌ Disadvantages:
- May introduce latency due to inspection of traffic.
- Can be bypassed if misconfigured.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:
- Commonly used in web proxies, email filtering, and web security appliances.

---

### ✅ 1.4 Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)

**Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)** integrate traditional firewall features with advanced security capabilities, making them more effective against modern cyber threats.

#### 🛠 Features:
- Combines **deep packet inspection (DPI)** with traditional packet filtering and stateful inspection.
- Provides **intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS)**.
- **Application awareness** — Inspects and controls traffic based on applications, not just ports and protocols.
- **SSL decryption** — Can inspect encrypted traffic.

#### 🧩 Advantages:
- Provides granular control over application-level traffic.
- Can detect and block complex, sophisticated attacks such as **advanced persistent threats (APTs)**.
- Includes **antivirus**, **anti-bot**, and **web filtering** capabilities.

#### ❌ Disadvantages:
- More expensive than traditional firewalls.
- Requires significant resources and can add latency.

#### 🔧 Use Cases:
- Deployed at **enterprise network boundaries** to defend against advanced cyber threats.
- Suitable for **cloud environments** and **multi-layered defense strategies**.

| Firewall Type             | Key Features                                                 | Advantages                                                | Disadvantages                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Packet Filtering**       | Basic, inspects packets individually.                       | Efficient, low resource usage                             | Vulnerable to advanced attacks like IP spoofing.     |
| **Stateful Inspection**    | Tracks the state of active connections.                     | Provides context-based filtering, secure connections.     | Requires more resources, may slow down performance.  |
| **Proxy Firewall**         | Intercepts traffic between client and server.               | Content inspection, adds anonymity for internal systems.  | Introduces latency, can be bypassed if misconfigured. |
| **Next-Gen Firewalls**     | Integrates DPI, IDS/IPS, app awareness, and SSL decryption. | Detects advanced threats, offers deep inspection.         | Expensive, requires high resources and expertise.    |
