# 202. Seven-Step Information Gathering Process

The EC-Council outlines a **seven-step process** for comprehensive information gathering during ethical hacking. This method helps security professionals methodically identify and understand a target system's vulnerabilities.

## 📊 Overview: The Seven Steps

| Step | Description                                   |
|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Gather Initial Information                    |
| 2    | Determine the Network Range                   |
| 3    | Identify Active Machines                      |
| 4    | Discover Open Ports and Access Points         |
| 5    | OS Fingerprinting                             |
| 6    | Fingerprint Services                          |
| 7    | Map the Network                               |

Each of these steps builds upon the previous one to provide a **complete picture of the target**.

## 🔍 Step 1: Gather Initial Information

This step involves collecting **basic public data** about the target using passive footprinting.

### 🧰 Techniques:
- WHOIS lookups
- DNS queries
- Website scanning
- Google Dorking
- Social engineering research

### 🛠 Tools:
- Netcraft
- Shodan
- Maltego
- Google Search Operators

> 🎯 Goal: Identify domain names, email addresses, contact info, server details.

---

## 🌐 Step 2: Determine the Network Range

The goal is to find the **IP address range** owned or used by the target.

### 🔧 Methods:
- ARIN/APNIC/RIPE WHOIS lookups
- DNS interrogation (Zone transfer)
- Traceroute to discover edge devices

### 🛠 Tools:
- ARIN.net / RIPE / APNIC databases
- Whois lookup services
- DNSDumpster

> 📍 Example: WHOIS data reveals `192.168.10.0/24` as an assigned range.

---

## 💻 Step 3: Identify Active Machines

Now, identify which hosts or IPs in the range are currently **live (responding to probes).**

### 🧰 Techniques:
- ICMP Echo Requests (Ping sweep)
- TCP SYN/ACK scanning
- ARP requests on local networks

### 🛠 Tools:
- Nmap (`nmap -sn 192.168.10.0/24`)
- Angry IP Scanner
- Netdiscover (for ARP scanning)

> 🧠 Active hosts are those that reply, allowing deeper analysis in the next steps.

---

## 🔓 Step 4: Discover Open Ports and Access Points

For each active machine, scan for **open ports** that might provide entry into the system.

### 🔧 Techniques:
- Full port scan or top-1000 TCP/UDP ports
- SYN/FIN/XMAS scans to evade firewalls

### 🛠 Tools:
- Nmap (`nmap -sS -T4 -p-`)
- Netcat (`nc -zv`)
- Unicornscan

> 🔍 Open ports expose potential **services or vulnerabilities** (e.g., SSH, FTP, HTTP).

---

## 🧬 Step 5: OS Fingerprinting

Determine the **operating system** of each active host to understand how best to exploit or defend it.

### 🧰 Techniques:
- TCP/IP stack behavior analysis
- TTL values, window sizes
- Error message responses

### 🛠 Tools:
- Nmap (`-O` flag for OS detection)
- Xprobe2
- p0f (passive OS fingerprinting)

> 📌 OS info helps narrow down exploit choices or patch weaknesses.

---

## 📡 Step 6: Fingerprint Services

Identify the **specific services and versions** running on open ports.

### 🔧 Techniques:
- Banner grabbing (read responses from open services)
- Protocol negotiation
- HTTP headers, SMTP responses

### 🛠 Tools:
- Netcat (`nc` to connect and grab banner)
- Telnet
- Nmap (`-sV` service version detection)

> 🧪 Example: HTTP Server → Apache 2.4.41 running on Ubuntu

---

## 🗺️ Step 7: Map the Network

Create a **logical diagram** of the network layout, relationships between systems, and possible attack paths.

### 🧰 Methods:
- Combine data from all previous steps
- Identify trust relationships, gateways, firewalls
- Highlight critical assets or chokepoints

### 🛠 Tools:
- Nmap with topology output
- Zenmap (graphical view)
- Maltego (visual data relationships)

> 🎯 Output: A network diagram with known hosts, OSes, services, and trust paths.

## 📘 Summary of the 7 Steps

1. **Gather Information** – Passive discovery of public data
2. **Determine Network Range** – Define the target IP space
3. **Identify Active Machines** – Detect live hosts
4. **Discover Open Ports** – Find services and entry points
5. **OS Fingerprinting** – Determine target OS for each machine
6. **Service Fingerprinting** – Get service version details
7. **Network Mapping** – Visualize the environment
